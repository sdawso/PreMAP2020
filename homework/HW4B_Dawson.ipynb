Doc-strings are REALLY important when working on a long term research project. You will likely need to go back to code you write a couple of weeks/months/years ago and you need to understand what it does. In addition to adding doc-strings, make sure you comment your code. I always add comments with units for constants, because this can help clarify bugs later on! Check back to your functions notebook from class if you need to remember the syntax for adding a doc-string."
